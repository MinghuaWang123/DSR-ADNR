System-specific notes
The code was tested in Matlab R2018b or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

# How to use it?
Directly run demo_San_Diego.m to reproduce the results on the Sandiego_new.mat, which exists in the aforementioned paper.
Note that the data can be included in the file.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters (important).

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
